	CARDS_RULE	{We'll play 'twenty one.' The rules are simple. In the deck are 36 cards, from sixes to aces. Aces are 11; kings are 4; queens are 3; Jacks are 2. Everything else is what's on the face. The goal is to rack up 21 points. \n We are each dealt one card, then take the ones we lack. (Click on the deck.) Click the profile to the upper-right to end the turn. If the score runs over 21, then the game ends. Each card is a bet. You can start a game if you have enough money for three wagers. To repeat a game, click on the deck. To exit, cross or [Esc].}

	DICE_RULE {Let's play poker joker. Five dice per player; you roll 'em each in turn. You can roll any number of dice, and put a wager on each one, but only the once. The goal is to toss the highest roll. \n In rising value: one pair (2), two pairs (2+2), triad (3), full (3+2), care (4), street (cubes in order), and poker (5). If there's a tie, the winner is the one with the higher combination. Click on the glass to roll the bones; click on the dice to roll again. (You need money for the wager.) Click on the portrait to pass a turn (when you don't need to roll again).}
